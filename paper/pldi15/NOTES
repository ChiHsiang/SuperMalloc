 it's pretty good (it's basically as fast as SuperMalloc)
 thread-private heap
 claim: space blowup
   1) The paper says it never returns space to the OS (for small objects.  Large objects are different)
   2) The code seems to allocate 16KB at a time into the local pools
   3) A hacky priority bin ("empty enough blocks" are put into the linked list next to the currently active block so that they can be found quickly)
   4) When returning a "foreign" block (one that was allocated by a different thread), they put it into a separate list.
   5) their cross-test sounds similar to malloc-test

note: ReinefeldDoSc13 shows the importance of malloc.
